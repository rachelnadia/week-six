# Notes for Week 6

This week I am using the Mrs. Thompson Advises column in the Globe and Mail from 1950-1959 that returns the search word alcohol to examine the societal impacts of alcohol on family life.

First, I downloaded all the articles and OCR'd them in R to get txt files.

Then I ran them through the Topic Modelling Tool.
