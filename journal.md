# Reflection for Week Six

This week I tied everything together and practiced some exploratory analysis int he cycle of digital history. Last week I created an academic poster on a paper I had written on the Mrs. Thompson Advises column in the Globe and Mail - particularily its discussion of alcohol in the 1950s. 
I decided that this week I was going to use the same column and conduct a digital analysis. I chose this column for two reasons: one, I am still a little unsure of some of the digital techniques therefore I thought that havinf a column I was interested in and familiar with could be helpful, and two, later I will conduct a comparative analysis of my results from my manual analysis which I demonstrated in the poster last week, and the digital results from this week. The purpose of this is to explore what we reflected on in week five of what might be missing from digital historical argumentation.

First, I will take you through the process of what I did this week.
