# Reflection for Week Six

This week I tied everything together and practiced some exploratory analysis int he cycle of digital history. Last week I created an academic poster on a paper I had written on the Mrs. Thompson Advises column in the Globe and Mail - particularily its discussion of alcohol in the 1950s. 
I decided that this week I was going to use the same column and conduct a digital analysis. I chose this column for two reasons: one, I am still a little unsure of some of the digital techniques therefore I thought that havinf a column I was interested in and familiar with could be helpful, and two, later I will conduct a comparative analysis of my results from my manual analysis which I demonstrated in the poster last week, and the digital results from this week. The purpose of this is to explore what we reflected on in week five of what might be missing from digital historical argumentation.

## Process

First, I will take you through the process of what I did this week.

I accessed the Globe and Mail database through MacOdrum library. In the advances search, I used the terms Mrs. Thompson Advises AND alcohol. After getting the results, I narrowed them down to the results from 1950-1959 - the same era I used for my manual analysis. I was left with 20 results. Each of the 20 columns I downloaded as a jpg file and saved it in its own folder. 

I then opened RStudio to use OCR to get a text file for each column. I proceeded to copy these text outputs into their own folder called input within a tmt folder.

I ran this input throguh the Topic Modelling Tool. With my results, I continuously went back and forth between the .cvs and the .html output. This process was time consuming and depending on howw much time I had to work on the project, I know I could have done a more in depth analysis of the topics. In the end, I decided on three topics that I was going to analyze in greater depth. I will talk about those results below.

Using my text file results from running an OCR, I copied the output text into an excel file to create a corpus of the columns. To each row I added the date and the title of the newspaper (Globe and Mail). I uploaded this text corpus to Voyant for a more visual analysis. In Voyant, I added many words to the stop list to weed out the jibberish of the unrecognizable words frm the OCR. I mostly made reference to the word cloud which I will talk about more below.

Finally, I decided to share my results using a poster format. I created this poster in Inkscape. I chose a poster because I felt that these documents led to an analysis that could be better understood visually. Also, as mentioned above, I wanted to compare the poster to the one I made regarding my manual analysis of thes columns.
